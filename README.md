# License Generation and Management System (LG&MS) 🚀


The LG&M system consists of two parts;
- GUI ``react`` 
- Backend API and Server ``node-js``

## Use Cases:

Once the system-administrator logs-in through the license manager GUI, he will navigate to a License generation page.

**Manual  Method:** 
- All the inputs should be taken through the UI and the user should be able to **generate** and **download** the license file _with given format_.
- All generated licenses should be **stored** in separate locations.
- System should **generate** a separate email in case a license is about to **expire** and that should be **sent** to the system-administrator.
- System admin should be able to log in through a **link** that is **sent** in that email and **renew** the license _selecting the license period_.
- System administrator should be able to **search** through previously generated license and should be able to retrieve the details
- System should be able store client (device owner) email, name and remarks to _enter miscellaneous details_.
